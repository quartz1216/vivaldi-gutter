# vivaldi-gutter
> [!NOTE]
> Vivaldi's UI has undergone significant evolution recently.
> While primarily focused on implementing auto-hide, now that it's officially supported, this CSS is no longer necessary.
> We'll retain only the transitions for pages where it's not implemented and remove the rest.
> We extend our gratitude to Vivaldi Technologies and its all!
